This game was created as an assignment for the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" on Udemy.
It's a simple Side-Scrolling jumping game using Unity's sprite shape tool.
You control the snow boarder with right and left arrow keys. If you get to the red finish line you win, but if you hit your head along the way you lose.
